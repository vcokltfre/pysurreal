# Contributing to pysurreal

Thank you for your interest in contributing to pysurreal!

There are a few important rules which must be followed when contributing to the library:

1. Unless you are fixing a small bug/typo/similar, always open an issue and wait for it to be assigned to you before you create a pull request.
2. Follow the commit conventions laid out below.
3. Lint before you PR. You can run the project's chosen linter settings by using `poetry run task lint`.

## Commit Conventions
